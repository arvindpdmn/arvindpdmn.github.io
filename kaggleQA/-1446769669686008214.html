Having a driver 's permit for a certain length of time is usually one of the requirements ( along with driver 's education and a road test ) for applying for a full driver 's license . To get a learner 's permit , one must typically pass a written permit test , traffic , and rules of the road . </P><span class="tooltip">&#9664;<span class="tooltiptext">344</span></span></div> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Australia </Li> <Li> 2 Belgium </Li> <Li> 3 Canada </Li> <Li> 4 France </Li> <Li> 5 Germany </Li> <Li> 6 Hong Kong </Li> <Li> 7 India </Li> <Li> 8 Ireland </Li> <Li> 9 New Zealand </Li> <Li> 10 Norway </Li> <Li> 11 Singapore </Li> <Li> 12 South Africa </Li> <Li> 13 Sweden </Li> <Li> 14 United Kingdom </Li> <Li> 15 United States <Ul> <Li> 15.1 Learner 's permits </Li> <Li> 15.2 Intermediate license </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 16 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Australia ( edit ) </H2> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip">&#9654;<span class="tooltiptext">444</span></span><P> Laws regarding learner 's permits in Australia differ between states .

When a person is on their learners permit , they have to log 50 -- 120 hours depending on the state they are in , and must obtain at least 5 night hours .

Once the practical driving test has been taken and passed , a full driving licence will be automatically issued .

The only restrictions are that the learner driver can not drive on motorways and must visibly display ' L ' plates at all times .

The holder of a learner 's licence is allowed to drive only when supervised by a licensed driver . If the category of vehicle being driven requires a professional driving permit , the licensed driver must also hold a professional driving permit . South African Learners must carry their Learner 's Licence with them whenever they are driving a vehicle and have L plates on the rear window .

When driving under a provisional licence , the learner must be accompanied by a driver who has held a full driving licence for three years , and who is 21 or over . The supervisor has to be in view of the road , however the road safety act 1988 states that the supervisor does not have to be in the passenger seat , although the passenger in the front seat does have to be over the age of 15 . A full licence can be acquired as soon as the provisional licence is received , unlike many other countries where applicants must wait a minimum of 6 -- 12 months with this being said , before getting a full license . The provisional licence is available without taking a test , although to get a full , unrestricted licence - the applicant must take a written ' Theory ' test containing fifty multiple choice questions and fourteen - clip hazard perception test , both of which are done on a computer at one of the many DSA ( Driving Standards Agency ) Test centres . Once the learner has passed the theory test , they may take the practical driving test , however the practical driving test has to be done within 2 years of completing the theory test , as the theory test certificate expires 2 years after receiving it . Once the practical driving test has been taken and passed a full driving licence will be automatically issued . While it is possible to take both tests immediately after each other , most learner drivers take a period between taking the theory and applying for a practical test to carry out driving lessons , either with their supervisor or a professional Driving school . </P><span class="tooltip">&#9664;<span class="tooltiptext">3750</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip">&#9654;<span class="tooltiptext">3750</span></span><P> The vehicle being driven by the learner must also be fitted with L - plates on both the back and front of the vehicle . This tells other road users that the vehicle is being operated by a driver without their full licence and that they may make mistakes easily and that the driver may not be fully competent yet . The L - plate consists of a white square plate ( often tied to the vehicle or attached by magnets ) with a large red L in the middle . In Wales the L - plate or the D - plate may be used due to bilingual laws in effect in Wales . If the vehicle is operated by multiple named drivers ( As specified by the car insurance policy ) , then the L - Plate should be removed and stored if the current driver holds a full licence . When the learner has passed , they can get a non-compulsory ' P ' plate , which shows that they have just passed their test , and so may not have much experience on the road . The P plate has a white background , with a green ' P ' . </P><span class="tooltip">&#9664;<span class="tooltiptext">3956</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip">&#9654;<span class="tooltiptext">3956</span></span><P> In the UK , provisional licence holders are disallowed from driving on motorways until they pass the practical test . </P><span class="tooltip">&#9664;<span class="tooltiptext">3978</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip">&#9654;<span class="tooltiptext">3978</span></span><P> After gaining a full licence , the driver is subject to a probationary period ; 6 or more penalty points accumulated within 2 years of passing the test , will lead to a revocation of the licence and both test will need to be retaken . </P><span class="tooltip">&#9664;<span class="tooltiptext">4026</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip">&#9654;<span class="tooltiptext">4026</span></span><P> In Northern Ireland for one year after the passing of a driving test , the driver is defined as a `` restricted driver '' who must not exceed 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) and must display an `` R - plate '' consisting of an amber sans - serif R on a white background . </P><span class="tooltip">&#9664;<span class="tooltiptext">4086</span></span></div> <H2> United states ( edit ) </H2> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip">&#9654;<span class="tooltiptext">4093</span></span><P> In the United States , it is typical for states to have graduated driver 's license programs through which a driver first obtains a learner 's permit , qualifies for an intermediate driver 's license , and then ultimately qualifies for a full driver 's license .

Some states allow drivers over the age of twenty - one to bypass the entire graduated licensing process . For example , in Colorado , a driver over the age of twenty - one may apply for and pass the tests for a permit and a full driver 's license on the same day and , if successful in passing the tests , may obtain a full driver 's license as soon as the driver passes a scheduled driving test . </P><span class="tooltip">&#9664;<span class="tooltiptext">4723</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip">&#9654;<span class="tooltiptext">4723</span></span><P> Intermediate drivers are normally restricted in their transportation of passengers , especially minor passengers , without supervision .
