There were numerous new nations in Eastern Europe , most of them small in size . The United States gained dominance in world finance . Thus , when Germany could no longer afford war reparations to Britain , France and other Allies , the Americans came up with the Dawes Plan and Wall Street invested heavily in Germany , which repaid its reparations to nations that , in turn , used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington . By the middle of the decade , prosperity was widespread , with the second half of the decade known , especially in Germany , as the `` Golden Twenties '' . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">881</span></span></div> <H2> International relations ( edit ) </H2> Main article : International relations ( 1919 -- 1939 ) <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">898</span></span><P> The important stages of interwar diplomacy and international relations included resolutions of wartime issues , such as reparations owed by Germany and boundaries ; American involvement in European finances and disarmament projects ; the expectations and failures of the League of Nations ; the relationships of the new countries to the old ; the distrustful relations of the Soviet Union to the capitalist world ; peace and disarmament efforts ; responses to the Great Depression starting in 1929 ; the collapse of world trade ; the collapse of democratic regimes one by one ; the growth of economic autarky ; Japanese aggressiveness toward China ; Fascist diplomacy , including the aggressive moves by Mussolini 's Italy and Hitler 's Germany ; the Spanish Civil War ; the appeasement of Germany 's expansionist moves toward the Rhineland , Austria , and Czechoslovakia , and the last , desperate stages of rearmament as the second world war increasingly loomed . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1058</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1058</span></span><P> Disarmament was high on the popular agenda . The League of Nations played little role , but the United States and Britain took the lead . U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes sponsored the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 in fixing how many major ships each major country was allowed . The new allocations were actually followed and there were no naval races in the 1920s . Britain played a leading role in the 1927 Geneva Naval Conference and the 1930 London Conference that led to the London Naval Treaty . However the refusal of Japan , Germany , Italy and Russia to go along led to the meaningless Second London Naval Treaty of 1936 . Naval disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany and Japan . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1194</span></span></div> <H2> Roaring Twenties ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : 1920s , Roaring Twenties , Golden Twenties , and Années folles <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1215</span></span><P> The `` Roaring Twenties '' highlighted novel and highly visible social and cultural trends and innovations . These trends , made possible by sustained economic prosperity , were most visible in major cities like New York , Chicago , Paris , Berlin , and London . The Jazz Age began and Art Deco peaked . For women , knee - length skirts and dresses became socially acceptable , as did bobbed hair with a marcel wave . The young women who pioneered these trends were called `` flappers '' . Not all was new : `` normalcy '' returned to politics in the wake of hyper - emotional wartime passions in the United States , France , and Germany . The leftist revolutions in Finland , Poland , Germany , Austria , Hungary , and Spain were defeated by conservatives , but succeeded in Russia , which became the base for Soviet Communism . In Italy the fascists came to power under Mussolini after threatening a March on Rome in 1922 . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1389</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1389</span></span><P> Most independent countries enacted women 's suffrage in the interwar era , including Canada in 1917 ( though Quebec held out longer ) , Britain in 1918 , and the United States in 1920 .

If women could work in munitions factories , it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the polling booth . But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work ; the point was that women 's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women 's entry into the public arena . </Dd><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1561</span></span></div> </Dl><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1562</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1562</span></span><P> In Europe , according to Derek Aldcroft and Steven Morewood , `` Nearly all countries registered some economic progress in the 1920s and most of them managed to regain or surpass their pre-war income and production levels by the end of the decade . '' The Netherlands , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland , and Greece did especially well , while Eastern Europe did poorly . In advanced economies the prosperity reached middle class households and many in the working class . with radio , automobiles , telephones , and electric lighting and appliances . There was unprecedented industrial growth , accelerated consumer demand and aspirations , and significant changes in lifestyle and culture . The media began to focus on celebrities , especially sports heroes and movie stars . Major cities built large sports stadiums for the fans , in addition to palatial cinemas . The mechanization of agriculture continued apace , producing on expansion of output that lowered prices , and made many farm workers redundant . Often they moved to nearby industrial towns and cities . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1743</span></span></div> <H2> Great Depression ( edit ) </H2> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1750</span></span><P> The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place after 1929 . The timing varied across nations ; in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s . It was the longest , deepest , and most widespread depression of the 20th century . The depression originated in the United States and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29 , 1929 ( known as Black Tuesday ) . Between 1929 and 1932 , worldwide GDP fell by an estimated 15 % . By comparison , worldwide GDP fell by less than 1 % from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession . Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s . However , in many countries , the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1896</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1896</span></span><P> The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries both rich and poor . Personal income , tax revenue , profits , and prices dropped , while international trade plunged by more than 50 % . Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25 % and in some countries rose as high as 33 % . Prices fell sharply , especially for mining and agricultural commodities . Business profits fell sharply as well , with a sharp reduction in new business starts . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1979</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1979</span></span><P> Cities all around the world were hit hard , especially those dependent on heavy industry . Construction was virtually halted in many countries . Farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by about 60 % . Facing plummeting demand with few alternative sources of jobs , areas dependent on primary sector industries such as mining and logging suffered the most . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2045</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2045</span></span><P> The Weimar Republic in Germany gave way to two episodes of political and economic turmoil , the first culminated in the German hyperinflation of 1923 and the failed Beer Hall Putsch of that same year . The second convulsion , brought on by the worldwide depression , resulted in the rise of Nazism .

Economic disaster led to a distrust in the effectiveness of democracy and its collapse in most of Europe , including the Baltic and Balkan countries , Poland , Spain , and Portugal . Powerful expansionary dictatorships emerged in Italy , Japan , and Germany . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2183</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2183</span></span><P> While communism was tightly contained in the isolated Soviet Union , fascism took control of Italy in 1922 ; as the depression worsened , it took over Germany , and played a major role in numerous countries in Europe , and several in Latin America . Fascist parties sprang up , attuned to local right - wing traditions , but also possessing common features that typically included extreme militaristic nationalism , economic self - containment , threats and aggression toward neighboring countries , oppression of minorities , ridicule of democracy while using its techniques to mobilize an angry lower middle class base , and disgust with cultural liberalism . Fascists believed in power , violence , male superiority , and a natural hierarchy , often led by dictators such as Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler . Fascism in power meant that liberalism and human rights were discarded and individual pursuits and values were subordinated to what the party decided was best . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2347</span></span></div> <H3> Spanish Civil War ( 1936 -- 39 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Spanish Civil War <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2366</span></span><P> Spain had never had a stable history in centuries , and in 1936 - 39 was wracked by one of the bloodiest civil wars of the 20th century . The real importance comes from outside countries . Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany gave munitions and strong military units to the rebel Nationalists , led by General Francisco Franco . The Republican ( or `` Loyalist '' ) government , which had been elected in a democratic election in 1935 , was on the defensive , but it received significant help from the Soviet Union , and from international volunteers . Led by Great Britain and France , and including the United States , most countries remained neutral and refused to provide armaments to either side . The fear was that this localized conflict would escalate into a European conflagration that was strongly opposed by the vast majority of Europeans and Americans . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2520</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2520</span></span><P> The Spanish Civil War was marked by numerous small battles and sieges , and many atrocities , until the Nationalists won in 1939 . The military intervention was decisive , as the Spanish army sided with the Nationalists , and together with Italian infantry and German air force and armored units overwhelmed the government forces . The Soviet Union provided armaments but never enough to equip the heterogeneous government militias and the `` International Brigades '' of outside far - left volunteers . The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict , but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted all the Communists and many socialists and liberals against Catholics , conservatives and fascists . Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another world war was imminent , and that it would be worth fighting for . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2667</span></span></div> <H2> Great Britain and its Empire ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Interwar Britain The Second British Empire at its territorial peak in 1921 . <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2693</span></span><P> The changing world order that the war had brought about , in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers , and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland , caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy . Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan , Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty , where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States . The issue of the empire 's security was a serious concern in Britain , as it was vital to the British pride , its finance , and its trade - oriented economy . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2812</span></span></div> George V with the British and Dominion prime ministers at the 1926 Imperial Conference . <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2827</span></span><P> India strongly supported the Empire in the First World War . It expected a reward , but failed to get home rule as the Raj kept control in British hands and feared another rebellion like that of 1857 . The Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence . Mounting tension , particularly in the Punjab region , culminated in the Amritsar Massacre in 1919 . Nationalism surged and centered in the Congress Party led by Mohandas Gandhi . In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre , between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy , and those who viewed it with revulsion . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2944</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2944</span></span><P> Egypt had been under de facto British control since the 1880s , despite its nominal ownership by the Ottoman Empire . In 1922 it was granted formal independence , though it continued to be a client state following British guidance . Egypt joined the League of Nations . Egypt 's King Faud and his son King Farouk , and their conservative allies , stayed in power with lavish lifestyles thanks to an informal alliance with Britain who would protect them from both secular and Muslim radicalism . Iraq , a British mandate since 1920 , gained official independence in 1932 when King Faisal agreed to British terms of a military alliance and an assured flow of oil . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">3064</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">3064</span></span><P> In Palestine , Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews . The 1917 Balfour Declaration , which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate , stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine , and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power . This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population , who openly revolted in 1936 . As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s , Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland , and shifted to a pro-Arab stance , limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">3197</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">3197</span></span><P> The Dominions ( Canada , Newfoundland , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa and Ireland ) were self - governing and gained semi-independence in the World War .

The Treaty stripped Germany of all of its overseas colonies , of Alsace and Lorraine , and of predominantly Polish districts . The Allied armies occupied industrial sectors in western Germany including the Rhineland , and Germany was not allowed to have a real army , navy , or air force .

The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to passive resistance : shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers , coal mines would not dig for the foreign troops , trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street . The German government printed vast quantities of paper money , causing hyperinflation , which also damaged the French economy . The passive resistance proved effective , insofar as the occupation became a loss - making deal for the French government . But the hyperinflation caused many prudent savers to lose all the money they had saved . Weimar added new internal enemies every year , as anti-democratic Nazis , Nationalists , and Communists battled each other in the streets .

In October 1925 the Treaty of Locarno was signed by Germany , France , Belgium , Britain , and Italy ; it recognised Germany 's borders with France and Belgium . Moreover , Britain , Italy , and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rhineland .

When opponents tried to appease him , he accepted the gains that were offered , then went to the next target . That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the League of Nations ( 1933 ) , rejected the Versailles Treaty , and began to re-arm ( 1935 ) , won back the Saar ( 1935 ) , remilitarized the Rhineland ( 1936 ) , formed an alliance ( `` axis '' ) with Mussolini 's Italy ( 1936 ) , sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War ( 1936 -- 39 ) , seized Austria ( 1938 ) , took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French appeasement of the Munich Agreement of 1938 , formed a peace pact with Joseph Stalin 's Soviet Union in August 1939 , and finally invaded Poland in September 1939 .

On 12 March 1938 , German troops marched into Austria , where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934 . When Austrian - born Hitler entered Vienna , he was greeted by loud cheers . Four weeks later , 99 % of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation ( Anschluss ) of their country Austria to the German Reich .

However , hardly six months after the Munich Agreement , in March 1939 , Hitler used the smoldering quarrel between Slovaks and Czechs as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia .

The matter was taken by Greece to the League of Nations , where Mussolini was convinced by Britain to evacuate Italian troops , in return for reparations from Greece . The confrontation led Britain and Italy to resolve the question of Jubaland in 1924 , which was merged into Italian Somaliland . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">4738</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">4738</span></span><P> During the late 1920s , imperial expansion became an increasingly favoured theme in Mussolini 's speeches . Amongst Mussolini 's aims were that Italy had to become the dominant power in the Mediterranean that would be able to challenge France or Britain , as well as attain access to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans . Mussolini alleged that Italy required uncontested access to the world 's oceans and shipping lanes to ensure its national sovereignty . This was elaborated on in a document he later drew up in 1939 called `` The March to the Oceans '' , and included in the official records of a meeting of the Grand Council of Fascism . This text asserted that maritime position determined a nation 's independence : countries with free access to the high seas were independent ; while those who lacked this , were not . Italy , which only had access to an inland sea without French and British acquiescence , was only a `` semi-independent nation '' , and alleged to be a `` prisoner in the Mediterranean '' : </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">4922</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">4922</span></span><P> The bars of this prison are Corsica , Tunisia , Malta , and Cyprus .

Malta and Cyprus constitute a threat to all our positions in the eastern and western Mediterrean . Greece , Turkey , and Egypt have been ready to form a chain with Great Britain and to complete the politico - military encirclement of Italy . Thus Greece , Turkey , and Egypt must be considered vital enemies of Italy 's expansion ... The aim of Italian policy , which can not have , and does not have continental objectives of a European territorial nature except Albania , is first of all to break the bars of this prison ... Once the bars are broken , Italian policy can only have one motto -- to march to the oceans . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">5082</span></span></div> -- Benito Mussolini , The March to the Oceans <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">5091</span></span><P> In the Balkans , the Fascist regime claimed Dalmatia and held ambitions over Albania , Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Vardar Macedonia , and Greece based on the precedent of previous Roman dominance in these regions . Dalmatia and Slovenia were to be directly annexed into Italy while the remainder of the Balkans was to be transformed into Italian client states . The regime also sought to establish protective patron - client relationships with Austria , Hungary , Romania , and Bulgaria . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">5179</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">5179</span></span><P> In both 1932 and 1935 , Italy demanded a League of Nations mandate of the former German Cameroon and a free hand in Ethiopia from France in return for Italian support against Germany ( see Stresa Front ) . This was refused by French Prime Minister Édouard Herriot , who was not yet sufficiently worried about the prospect of a German resurgence . The failed resolution of the Abyssinia Crisis led to the Second Italo - Ethiopian War , in which Italy annexed Ethiopia to its empire . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">5269</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">5269</span></span><P> Italy 's stance towards Spain shifted between the 1920s and the 1930s . The Fascist regime in the 1920s held deep antagonism towards Spain due to Miguel Primo de Rivera 's pro-French foreign policy . In 1926 , Mussolini began aiding the Catalan separatist movement , which was led by Francesc Macià , against the Spanish government . With the rise of the left - wing Republican government replacing the Spanish monarchy , Spanish monarchists and fascists repeatedly approached Italy for aid in overthrowing the Republican government , in which Italy agreed to support them in order to establish a pro-Italian government in Spain . In July 1936 , Francisco Franco of the Nationalist faction in the Spanish Civil War requested Italian support against the ruling Republican faction , and guaranteed that , if Italy supported the Nationalists , `` future relations would be more than friendly '' and that Italian support `` would have permitted the influence of Rome to prevail over that of Berlin in the future politics of Spain '' . Italy intervened in the civil war with the intention of occupying the Balearic Islands and creating a client state in Spain . Italy sought the control of the Balearic Islands due to its strategic position -- Italy could use the islands as a base to disrupt the lines of communication between France and its North African colonies and between British Gibraltar and Malta . After the victory by Franco and the Nationalists in the war , Allied intelligence was informed that Italy was pressuring Spain to permit an Italian occupation of the Balearic Islands . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">5540</span></span></div> Italian newspaper in Tunisia that represented Italians living in the French protectorate of Tunisia . <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">5555</span></span><P> After the United Kingdom signed the Anglo - Italian Easter Accords in 1938 , Mussolini and foreign minister Ciano issued demands for concessions in the Mediterranean by France , particularly regarding Djibouti , Tunisia and the French - run Suez Canal . Three weeks later , Mussolini told Ciano that he intended for Italy to demand an Italian takeover of Albania . Mussolini professed that Italy would only be able to `` breathe easily '' if it had acquired a contiguous colonial domain in Africa from the Atlantic to the Indian Oceans , and when ten million Italians had settled in them . In 1938 , Italy demanded a sphere of influence in the Suez Canal in Egypt , specifically demanding that the French - dominated Suez Canal Company accept an Italian representative on its board of directors . Italy opposed the French monopoly over the Suez Canal because , under the French - dominated Suez Canal Company , all Italian merchant traffic to its colony of Italian East Africa was forced to pay tolls on entering the canal . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">5737</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">5737</span></span><P> The local Albanian chieftain who in 1922 had himself proclaimed king as Zog I , failed to create a strong state . Albanian society was deeply divided by religion and language , with disputed borders and an undeveloped rural economy . In 1939 , Italy invaded and captured Albania and made it a part of the Italian Empire as a separate kingdom in personal union with the Italian crown . Italy had long built strong links with the Albanian leadership and considered it firmly within its sphere of influence . Mussolini wanted a spectacular success over a smaller neighbour to match Germany 's absorption of Austria and Czechoslovakia . Italian King Victor Emmanuel III took the Albanian crown , and a fascist government under Shefqet Verlaci was established to rule over Albania . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">5872</span></span></div> <H2> Regional patterns ( edit ) </H2> <H3> East Asia : Japanese dominance ( edit ) </H3> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">5889</span></span><P> The Japanese modelled their industrial economy closely on the most advanced European models . They started with textiles , railways , and shipping , expanding to electricity and machinery . the most serious weakness was a shortage of raw materials . Industry ran short of copper and coal became a net importer . A deep flaw in the aggressive military strategy was a heavy dependence on imports including 100 percent of the aluminum , 85 percent of the iron ore , and especially 79 percent of the oil supplies . it was one thing to go to war with China or Russia , but quite another to be in conflict with the key suppliers , especially the United States Britain and the Netherlands , which supply the oil and iron . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">6022</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">6022</span></span><P> Japan joined the Allies of the First World War in order to make territorial gains . Together with the British Empire it divided up Germany 's territories scattered in the Pacific and on the China coast ; they did not amount to very much . The other Allies pushed back hard against Japan 's efforts to dominate China through the Twenty - One Demands of 1915 . Its occupation of Siberia proved unproductive . Japan 's wartime diplomacy and limited military action had produced few results , and at the Paris Versailles peace conference . at the end of the war , Japan frustrated in its ambitions . At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 , its demands for racial parity , and an increasing diplomatic isolation . The 1902 alliance with Britain was not renewed in 1922 because of heavy pressure on Britain from Canada and the United States . In the 1920s Japanese diplomacy was rooted in an largely liberal democratic political system , and favored internationalism . By 1930 , however , Japan was rapidly reversing itself , rejecting democracy at home , as the Army seized more and more power , and rejecting internationalism and liberalism . By the late 1930s it had joined the Axis military alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">6243</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">6243</span></span><P> In 1930 , the London disarmament conference angered the Japanese Army and Navy . Japan 's navy demanded parity with the United States and Britain , but was rejected and the conference kept the 1921 ratios . Japan was required to scrap a capital ship . Extremists assassinated Japan 's prime minister and the military took more power , leading to the rapid decline in democracy . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">6312</span></span></div> Japan seizes Manchuria ( edit ) <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">6318</span></span><P> In September 1931 , the Japanese Army -- acting on its own without government approval -- seized control of Manchuria , an anarchic area that China had not controlled in decades . It set up a puppet government of Manchukuo . Britain and France effectively control the League of Nations , which issued the Lytton Report in 1932 , saying that Japan had genuine grievances , but it acted illegally in seizing the entire province . Japan quit the League , Britain took no action . The US Secretary of State announces that it would not recognize Japan 's conquest as legitimate . Germany welcomed Japan 's actions . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">6429</span></span></div> Toward conquest of China ( edit ) <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">6436</span></span><P> The civilian government in Tokyo tried to minimize the Army 's aggression in Manchuria , and announced it was withdrawing . On the contrary , the Army completed the conquest of Manchuria , and the civilian cabinet resigned . The political parties were divided on the issue of military expansion . The new Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi tried to negotiate with China , but was assassinated in the May 15 Incident in 1932 , which Ushered in an era of ultranationalism led by the Army and supported by patriotic societies . It ended civilian rule in Japan until after 1945 . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">6539</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">6539</span></span><P> The Army , however , was itself divided into cliques and factions with different strategic viewpoints . One faction saw The Soviet Union is the main enemy , the other sought to build a mighty empire based in Manchuria and northern China . The Navy , while smaller and less influential , was also factionalized . Large - scale warfare , known as the Second Sino - Japanese War , began in August 1937 , with naval and infantry attacks focused on Shanghai , which quickly spread to other major cities . There were numerous large - scale atrocities against Chinese civilians , such as the Nanking Massacre in December 1937 , with mass murder and mass rape . By 1939 military lines had stabilized , with Japan in control of almost all of the major Chinese cities and industrial areas . A puppet government was set up . In the U.S. , government and public opinion -- even including those who were isolationist regarding Europe -- was resolutely opposed to Japan and gave strong support to China . Meanwhile , the Japanese Army fared badly in large battles with Soviet forces in Mongolia at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in summer 1939 . The USSR was too powerful . Tokyo and Moscow signed a nonaggression treaty in April 1941 , as the militarists turned their attention to the European colonies to the south which had urgently needed oil fields . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">6782</span></span></div> <H3> Latin America ( edit ) </H3> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">6789</span></span><P> The Great Depression posed a great challenge to the region . The collapse of the world economy meant that the demand for raw materials drastically declined , undermining many of the economies of Latin America . Intellectuals and government leaders in Latin America turned their backs on the older economic policies and turned toward import substitution industrialization . The goal was to create self - sufficient economies , which would have their own industrial sectors and large middle classes and which would be immune to the ups and downs of the global economy . Despite the potential threats to United States commercial interests , the Roosevelt administration ( 1933 -- 1945 ) understood that the United States could not wholly oppose import substitution . Roosevelt implemented a Good Neighbor policy and allowed the nationalization of some American companies in Latin America . Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas nationalized American oil companies , out of which he created Pemex . Cárdenas also oversaw the redistribution of a quantity of land , fulfilling the hopes of many since the start of the Mexican Revolution . The Platt Amendment was also repealed , freeing Cuba from legal and official interference of the United States in its politics . The Second World War also brought the United States and most Latin American nations together , with Argentina the main hold out . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">7018</span></span></div> Sports ( edit ) <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">7022</span></span><P> Sports became increasingly popular , drawing enthusiastic fans to large stadia . The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) worked to encourage Olympic ideals and participation . Following the 1922 Latin American Games in Rio de Janeiro , the IOC helped to establish national Olympic committees and prepare for future competition . In Brazil , however , sporting and political rivalries slowed progress as opposing factions fought for control of international sport . The 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris and the 1928 Summer Olympics games in Amsterdam saw greatly increased participation from Latin American athletes . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">7120</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">7120</span></span><P> English and Scottish engineers had brought futebol ( soccer ) to Brazil in the late 19th century .
