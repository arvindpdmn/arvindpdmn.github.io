Instead they were dressed in ordinary business clothing . Since the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009 , the Justices of that court have retained the Law Lords ' tradition of sitting unrobed . On ceremonial occasions they wear a robe of black damask embellished with gold with the logotype of the Supreme Court embroidered at the yoke . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">626</span></span></div> England and Wales ( edit ) Where Court dress is worn ( edit ) <div class="candidate unknown"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">640</span></span><span class="tooltip pred-start pred-unknown"><span class="tooltiptext">640</span></span><P> Court dress is worn at hearings in open court in all Senior Courts of England and Wales and in county courts .

The reforms were due to take effect on 1 January 2008 ; however , following reports of strong opposition to the proposed changes , they were put on hold , eventually taking effect in autumn 2008 . The new robes for judges were designed by Betty Jackson and unveiled in May 2008 , although a survey of judges published in March 2009 revealed substantial opposition to the new designs , as well as widespread annoyance at the lack of consultation prior to the change . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">852</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">852</span></span><P> The Chairman of the Bar announced in April 2008 that , as a result of a survey of the profession , the Bar would recommend that advocates should retain their existing formal robes ( including wigs ) in all cases , civil and criminal , with possible exceptions in the County Court . In a letter to the profession , he said ( in part ) : </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">921</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">921</span></span><P> Criminal barristers will keep wigs and gowns , as the Lord Chief Justice intends to keep the current court dress in criminal proceedings . The Bar is a single advocacy profession with specialisation in particular practice areas . There is logic in having the same formal court dress , where formality and robes are required , for criminal and civil barristers ... There is strong identification of the Bar of England and Wales in the public 's mind and its formal dress nationally and internationally . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1009</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1009</span></span><P> For the most part , the changes only affect what is worn by judges in civil courts , who now wear a simplified robe and no wig . Dress worn in criminal courts remains largely unchanged . The changes have been reflected in the dress allowances made to judges ( while the one - off cost of supplying the new civil gown was estimated at about £ 200,000 , annual savings in the region of £ 300,000 were projected ) . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1092</span></span></div> Advocates ( edit ) Barristers ( short wig ) and Queen 's Counsels ( in full ceremonial dress with long wig ) <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1114</span></span><P> English and Welsh advocates ( whether barristers or solicitors ) who appear before a judge who is robed must themselves be robed . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1139</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1139</span></span><P> All male advocates wear a white stiff wing collar with bands ( two strips of linen about 5 by 1 in ( 127 by 25 mm ) hanging down the front of the neck ) . They also wear either a dark double - breasted suit ( or with waistcoat if single - breasted ) or a black coat and waistcoat and black or grey morning dress striped trousers . The black coat and waistcoat can be combined into a single garment , which is simply a waistcoat with sleeves , known as a bar jacket or court waistcoat . Female advocates also wear a dark suit , but often wear bands attached to a collarette rather than a wing collar . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1263</span></span></div> Junior barristers ( edit ) <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1268</span></span><P> Junior barristers wear an open - fronted black gown with open sleeves , gathered and decorated with buttons and ribbons , and a gathered yoke , over a black or dark suit , hence the term stuffgownsman for juniors . In addition barristers wear a short horsehair wig with curls at the side and ties down the back . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1329</span></span></div> Solicitors ( edit ) <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1333</span></span><P> Solicitors wear the same wing collar with bands , or collarette , as barristers . Their gowns are of a slightly different style , with a square collar and without gathered sleeves . By virtue of the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction at I. 1.1 ( as amended by Practice Direction ( Court Dress ) ( No4 ) ( 2008 ) 1 WLR 257 ) , `` Solicitors and other advocates authorised under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 ... may wear short wigs in circumstances where they would be worn by Queen 's Counsel or junior counsel .

For this reason , barristers who are appointed Queen 's Counsel are said to have `` taken silk '' , and QCs themselves are colloquially called `` silks '' . The QC 's black coat , known as a court coat , is cut like 18th - century court dress and the sleeve of the QC 's court coat or bar jacket has a turned back cuff with three buttons across . On special ceremonial occasions ( such as the opening of the legal year ) , QCs wear ( in addition to their court coat , waistcoat and silk gown ) a long wig , black breeches , silk stockings and buckled shoes , lace cuffs and a lace jabot instead of bands . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1615</span></span></div> Judges ( edit ) <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1619</span></span><P> Judicial robes have always exhibited variety depending on the status of the judge , the type of court and other considerations . In addition to robes , judges have generally worn a short bench wig when working in court ( reserving the long wig for ceremonial occasions ) and a wing collar and bands at the neck . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1679</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1679</span></span><P> All judges in criminal cases continue to wear these traditional forms of dress , which are described in more detail below . Judges in civil and family cases , however , have since 2008 worn a new design of working robe with no wig , collar or bands ; this plain , dark , zipped gown ( of ' midnight blue gabardine with facings in navy blue velvet ' ) is worn over an ordinary business suit and tie . The status of the wearer is indicated by a pair of different colored tabs below the collar : Appeal Court judges wear gold tabs , High Court judges wear red tabs , Masters of the High Court wear pink , and District judges wear blue . It was originally envisaged that Circuit judges sitting in the High Court would likewise adopt the new - style robe with purple tabs , but they opted to retain their violet robe as worn in the County Court . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1846</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1846</span></span><P> On special ceremonial occasions ( such as the opening of the legal year ) more elaborate forms of traditional dress are worn , by civil and criminal judges alike . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1878</span></span></div> The Lord Chief Justice ( edit ) The Lord Chief Justice <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1889</span></span><P> The Lord Chief Justice , when robed , dresses like a High Court Judge ( see below ) with the distinction of a train to his scarlet robe . On ceremonial occasions he wears the scarlet and fur hood and mantle , and in addition a gold chain of office in the form of a collar of esses .

In addition , the judge wears a wing collar , bands , and a short wig .

Judicial robes in the High Court of Justiciary are predominantly white and red , faced with red crosses over the white . The white and red robe of the Lord Justice Clerk is differentiated by many small perforations in the white satin , through which the red cloth shows giving an ermine - like impression . The Lord Justice General wears a red robe and hood ( without crosses ) edged in ermine ( black - spotted white fur ) .

To fit with the reorganization of the courts , the judiciary all but abandoned the wearing of their former ceremonial costumes . Prior to Independence , the Lord Chancellor , Master of the Rolls and the Lords Justice of Appeal in Ireland would have worn full ceremonial dress identical to their English equivalents , viz . long black damask robes with wide bands of gold lace and ornaments . The Lord Chief Justice , Lord Chief Baron ( up to the extinction of the office on the retirement of Christopher Palles in 1916 ) and other puisne judges of the High Court would likewise have worn scarlet robes with ermine hood and ermine - trimmed mantle .

Then in 1924 the Court of Appeal was refashioned into the Supreme Court ; the Lord Chief Justice became simply Chief Justice and head of the judiciary ; and the Master of the Rolls was replaced with a President of the High Court . The judges of the new superior courts , including the Chief Justice and President , adopted for all occasions -- ceremonial or otherwise -- the ordinary working judicial dress of the austere type previously worn by members of the old Court of Appeal , that is , as Order 119 rule 2 of the Rules of the Superior Courts , 1986 originally read : </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">7118</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">7118</span></span><P> A black coat and vest of uniform make and material of the kind worn by Senior Counsel , a black Irish poplin gown of uniform make and material , white bands and a wig of the kind known as the small or bobbed wig . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">7165</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">7165</span></span><P> Judges of the Circuit Court also wear similar costume , pursuant to Order 3 rule 1 of the Circuit Court Rules , 2001 .

Counsel may not exercise his right of audience unless he is properly attired . It is provided in Order 119 rule 3 of the Rules of the Superior Courts as follows : </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">7372</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">7372</span></span><P> Senior and Junior Counsel shall appear , when in court , habited in a dark colour and in such robes and bands and with such wigs as have heretofore been worn by Senior and Junior Counsel respectively , and no Counsel shall be heard in any case during the sittings unless so habited . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">7428</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">7428</span></span><P> It may therefore be said that Irish barristers robe similarly to their English counterparts . Such robes are worn by barristers in all courts , including the District Court . Like Queen 's Counsel in England , Senior Counsel generally wear a short bar wig and black silk or poplin gown with flap collar and long , closed sleeves over a buttoned and broad - cuffed court coat . Their shirts will have a detachable stiff wing collar , worn with bands . Junior Counsel wear a short bar wig and black poplin or stuff bar gown ( which has a gathered yoke and short , open sleeves ) over a dark three - piece suit with similar wing collar and bands . While it is not unknown for female barristers to wear a blouse with separate bands much like male colleagues , more commonly they would wear a starched white all - in - one collarette or bib covering their neckline that approximates in looks to a tall Mandarin collar and bands . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">7604</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">7604</span></span><P> Section 49 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 , however , did abolish the requirement that barristers should wear wigs in court . To this extent only , the wording of the Rules of Court above is somewhat out of date . ( All counsel still must wear a gown and bands etc . ) By affording individual barristers a discretion to wear the forensic wig in court , the new rule defused what had become an increasingly bitter debate in the profession whether it was appropriate to cleave to anachronistic modes of dress - even as a traditional and undoubtedly recognizable uniform - and avoided a more drastic solution , such as the abandonment of wigs or gowns altogether . Accordingly , there is little contemporary call for reform of court dress in Ireland . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">7744</span></span></div> Call to the bar ( edit ) <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">7751</span></span><P> Junior counsel are called to the Bar in three sittings in the year , one in Hilary term , one Trinity term , and the other in Michaelmas term .

( Junior counsel are members of the Outer or Utter Bar . ) On this occasion alone do the new Senior Counsel wear full - bottomed wigs , though with their working robes rather than with the breeches , stockings , patent court shoes and lace stock of former times .

The robes and neckties may bear the logo of the Israel Bar Association . ( Out of court , many lawyers will wear a Bar Association pin in their jacket lapel . ) While the practice of lawyers wearing court dress is a legacy of the British Mandate that immediately preceded Israeli independence , the relatively simple outfit ( and lack of wigs ) shows American influence ; both nations ' systems of law have similarly influenced Israel 's . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">8484</span></span></div> <H3> Italy ( edit ) </H3> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">8490</span></span><P> In Italy judges , prosecutors and lawyers wear black robes in higher courts or in criminal cases .

This is a symbolic act , as it is meant to convey the idea that the judge is merely the representative of Dutch or Belgian law , rather than an elevated individual with the power of sentencing people . This idea finds its origins in the time of the French revolution . However , there are some slight differences between the judge and the lawyer . The judge wears a black robe , with silk ties on the sleeves and on the closure of the robe . Lawyers just wear a simple black robe . The higher the rank in court , the fancier the robe becomes ; the members of the ' Hoge Raad ' ( High Council ) wear a velvet black robe with ermine ties . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">8708</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">8708</span></span><P> Previously , Dutch judges shared no common dress as the Spanish Netherlands and the Dutch Republic , as the Netherlands were highly decentralised with only provincial and urban law and no federal law .

Optional formal dress can be seen under the robes , such as bow ties . Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also wear lace jabots <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">8898</span></span><P> During the early history of the United States , the court dress of judges and practicing lawyers closely mirrored British court dress of the 18th century ; both wore white powdered wigs and ( typically ) black robes in the lower courts , and in the higher ones , judges would wear red with black markings . The practice fell out of favor and died out by the mid-nineteenth century . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">8971</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">8971</span></span><P> Today , generally judges of both state and federal courts are free to select their own courtroom attire , although some jurisdictions do formally require judges to wear robes of some kind when presiding over hearings in court . The most common choice is a plain black robe which covers the torso and legs , with sleeves . Female judges will sometimes add to the robe a plain white collar or lace jabot . Beneath the robes business attire is standard . Typically judges pay for their own custom made judicial robe . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">9066</span></span></div> William Cushing , showing early U.S. Supreme Court dress , with a wig <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">9079</span></span><P> Until the tenure of Chief Justice John Marshall , all Supreme Court justices wore red robes with ermine trim and full - bottomed wigs , reminiscent of British court dress . Marshall , however , eschewed this formality and began the practice of only wearing a black silk robe , with no wig . In 1994 , Chief Justice William Rehnquist added four gold bars ( similar in appearance to captain insignia in the US Navy ) to each sleeve of his black robe , but the change in his attire ( he had been Chief Justice since 1986 ) was his own innovation and was inspired by a production of the operetta Iolanthe , rather than any historical precedent . His successor , John G. Roberts , chose to stick with the traditional plain black robe . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">9219</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">9219</span></span><P> Some Supreme Court justices ( including Clarence Thomas , the late Antonin Scalia , and Stephen Breyer , all of whom are or were balding ) maintain the ancient legal practice of wearing large black skullcaps , in their case when wearing their robes outdoors in cold weather ( for example , at presidential inaugurations in January . ) </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">9280</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">9280</span></span><P> Many state supreme court justices wear unique styles of robes , the most notable being the Maryland Court of Appeals , where all judges wear red , and British - style tab collars . The judges of the Delaware Superior Court continue to wear the red sashes or baldrics of their British predecessors , albeit now only on ceremonial occasions . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">9343</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">9343</span></span><P> Some judges eschew special dress entirely and preside over their courts in normal business wear .

During the second - wave feminism movement in the 1970s , some judges forbade female attorneys to wear trousers when appearing in court , but pantsuits are now widely accepted . Like judges , American attorneys do not wear wigs . Attorneys in Hawaii may be allowed to wear aloha shirts in court , though this varies among individual courts . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">9457</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">9457</span></span><P> Until the 1970s , morning dress was required of all attorneys appearing before the United States Supreme Court by the Court 's rules . Even after the Court abolished the requirement , the Office of the Solicitor General maintained the practice . When the Solicitor General ( or any of the deputies ) appears before the U.S. Supreme Court , they wear morning dress , with striped trousers , grey ascot , waistcoat , and a cutaway morning coat . A feminized version is sometimes worn by female deputies , which consists of the same garments tailored to female measurements . Former Solicitor General Elena Kagan , the only woman to hold the office to date , appeared before the Court in pantsuits in lieu of morning dress . The traditional female equivalent of morning dress , `` softly flowing dresses with hats '' , is strictly for social purposes and would be inappropriate attire for appearances before the nation 's highest court . The Court 's Marshal and Clerk of both sexes also wear morning dress when the Court is in session . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">9643</span></span></div> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Possible reform of court dress Archived 6 March 2008 at the Wayback Machine . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Lord Chief Justice models new gown for judges '' .
