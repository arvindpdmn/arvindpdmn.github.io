Despite being ABC 's second - highest rated sitcom for the 2016 -- 17 season , it was revealed in May 2017 that the network had declined to renew Last Man Standing for a seventh season . Media publications reported that ABC was unwilling to cover the production costs for a seventh season on behalf of 20th Century Fox Television . One year later , the studio 's sibling network Fox announced it had picked up the show for a seventh season , which premiered on September 28 , 2018 . </P><span class="tooltip pred-end pred-unknown"><span class="tooltiptext">616</span></span><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">616</span></span></div> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Premise </Li> <Li> 2 Cast and characters <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Main </Li> <Li> 2.2 Recurring </Li> <Li> 2.3 Notable guest stars </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Episodes </Li> <Li> 4 Production <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Development and casting </Li> <Li> 4.2 Filming </Li> <Li> 4.3 Cancellation </Li> <Li> 4.4 Revival on Fox </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Reception <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Critical response </Li> <Li> 5.2 Ratings </Li> <Li> 5.3 Awards and nominations </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Home media </Li> <Li> 7 Syndication </Li> <Li> 8 Broadcast </Li> <Li> 9 Notes </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Premise ( edit ) </H2> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">730</span></span><P> The series follows Mike Baxter , a senior executive and director of marketing for an outdoor sporting goods store chain based in Denver , Colorado . His home life is initially filled with his wife , three daughters and a grandson , but later extends to the young men who are married to or dating his daughters . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">790</span></span></div> <H2> Cast and characters ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Main ( edit ) </H3> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">804</span></span><Ul> <div class="candidate-child"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">805</span></span><Li> Tim Allen as Michael `` Mike '' Baxter : Mike is a father of three daughters and the director of marketing for the Outdoor Man chain of sporting goods stores . He fervently supports `` traditional '' American values , is a Protestant and is politically conservative . Mike loves his daughters but says his favorite is Eve , the youngest and most athletic daughter , and whose political opinions and interests mirror his own . He is proud of her ability to excel at anything she tries , including school work , hunting and playing sports . Mike often finds himself annoyed with Outdoor Man 's young slow - witted employee Kyle ( who later becomes his son - in - law ) , and with Ryan , his politically liberal son - in - law married to his oldest daughter , and the father of Mike 's grandson , Boyd . The video blog or `` vlog '' that Mike does for Outdoor Man is frequently used as a vehicle to express his political views . Mike is a graduate of the University of Michigan , and an amateur radio operator using the call sign KA0XTT . </Li><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1006</span></span></div> <div class="candidate-child"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1006</span></span><Li> Nancy Travis as Vanessa Baxter , Mike 's wife : Vanessa is a geologist working in the energy industry for a company that does hydraulic fracturing , or `` fracking '' . In season four , Vanessa becomes frustrated with her job and decides to go back to college to become a high school science teacher . After being laid off as a teacher due to budget cuts , Vanessa begins her own tutoring business . Vanessa was ambiguous in her political views until season five , when she announces she is supporting Hillary Clinton for president , mainly because she thinks it will advance women 's causes . She is shown drinking wine frequently , and is also frequently mocked by Mike and her daughters about it . She is a graduate of Ohio State University with a Master of Science degree in Physics and a PhD in Geology . Vanessa often makes attempts to be politically correct , but only highlights how uncomfortable she is trying to relate to people of other races . Despite this , she and her African - American neighbor Carol Larabee seem to get along . Vanessa 's humor includes bad puns , which she thinks are amusing but really just irritate Mike and the girls to no end . </Li><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1225</span></span></div> <div class="candidate-child"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1225</span></span><Li> Amanda Fuller ( seasons 2 -- present ) and Alexandra Krosney ( season 1 ) as Kristin Beth Baxter , the oldest daughter : Kristin , unlike her father , espouses liberal political views and her views with regard to Christianity seem ambiguous . During her senior year of high school , Kristin became pregnant with her son , Boyd . She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until moving out in the season two finale . She began to reconcile with Boyd 's father , Ryan Vogelson , in season three , and the two get married between seasons four and five . Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two . In season four , she becomes the manager of the new restaurant opened by Outdoor Man . Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism , despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified . Alexandra Krosney portrayed Kristin in the show 's first season ( despite being nearly two years younger than Molly Ephraim , playing Kristin 's younger sister ) ; Krosney was replaced by Amanda Fuller prior to season two for unspecified creative reasons . </Li><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1451</span></span></div> <div class="candidate-child"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1451</span></span><Li> Molly Ephraim ( seasons 1 -- 6 ) and Molly McCook ( season 7 - present ) as Amanda Elaine `` Mandy '' Baxter - Anderson , the middle daughter : Mandy is not as academic as her sisters ( and she has a penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework ) , but she excels in social situations . Interested in fashion ( and little else ) , she was one of the most popular girls at her high school . Mandy is very confident and creative , demonstrating traits found in her father . She can be lazy , conceited , selfish , insulting , and delinquent -- she drinks underage , ignores all driving laws , shoplifts from Outdoor Man , there are many implications that she smokes cannabis , and she has been caught staying out all night -- but occasionally she displays moments of generosity and caring . She started dating Kyle in Season 2 . As of Season 3 , she attends a local college and works at the diner where Kristin used to work . Later that same season , she begins an online clothing business , selling her self - designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents ' house . Kyle asks her to marry him in Season 5 , the 100th episode . She marries Kyle in Season 6 , but they have yet to move out of the Baxter home . Up until she turned 21 , a running gag on the show was Mike , Vanessa , and occasionally Kristin snatching glasses of alcohol out of Mandy 's hand , usually followed by Mandy making a lame excuse . Ephraim was replaced by Molly McCook prior to the Season 7 revival on FOX due to Ephraim choosing not to return . </Li><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">1759</span></span></div> <div class="candidate-child"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">1759</span></span><Li> Kaitlyn Dever as Eve Baxter , ( series regular , seasons 1 -- 6 ; recurring , season 7 ) the youngest daughter : Eve is intelligent and athletic , and generally has the same interests as Mike , including camping , sports , guns , and the military . She also has conservative views like Mike . She is Mike 's favorite daughter , and excels at her hobbies . She frequently outplays the boys in soccer and makes the boys ' football team as their placekicker . She is well aware of being the favorite over her two sisters . Eve also shares her father 's sense of humor , and her sarcastic wit is frequently directed at clueless sister Mandy . Eve is an excellent student , whose only weak subject is art , though she did have to change math classes to escape a prejudiced teacher . Eve is a member of Army Junior ROTC and works toward gaining admittance to West Point . Her attempt to do so is unsuccessful , which seriously depresses her , so in season six , Eve decides to take a `` personal year '' rather than immediately attend college . She spends some of this time singing and playing guitar for money , but this proves to be unfruitful . During her gap year , Eve applies to the Air Force Academy in nearby Colorado Springs ( without telling either parent ) , and is accepted . Beginning in season seven , Airman Baxter is only a recurring character as she is now enrolled at the Academy . </Li><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2030</span></span></div> <div class="candidate-child"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2030</span></span><Li> Christoph Sanders as Kyle Anderson , a young employee at Outdoor Man : Kyle is universally recognized as a good guy . Kyle idolizes Mike , having grown up without a father figure . He takes care of his grandmother who has dementia , and it is implied he grew up in her home . His estranged mother passes away in season six , leaving Kyle with mixed feelings over how to deal with it . Kyle is often oblivious to social cues and is slow to catch on to the events happening around him . Kyle dated Kristin in season one and started dating Mandy in season two before proposing in season five , and marrying Mandy in season six . As of season seven , he has yet to level his mother 's trailer or break ground on building his own home , while it has been implied that he and Mandy ( but mostly Kyle ) are trying to conceive a baby . </Li><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2198</span></span></div> <div class="candidate-child"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2198</span></span><Li> Héctor Elizondo as Edward `` Ed '' Alzate , Mike 's longtime business partner : Ed started a bait and tackle shop many years ago and hired Mike , who helped turn the shop into the 20 - store Outdoor Man chain . Ed is perhaps fifteen years older than Mike , but the two men bond over similar outdoor hobbies and shared conservative values . Mike regularly talks to Ed about the happenings in his home and occasionally seeks advice . Having been divorced four times , Ed 's suggestions are rarely helpful . He also has five daughters . Ed is a Vietnam veteran , although he saw no combat in Vietnam , stating that he was a clerk in Saigon . He continues to help fellow veterans at the local Veterans of Foreign Wars hall with their Veteran Affairs paperwork . Ed is also a recurring target for jokes about his age and lack of hair , most often from Mike . </Li><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2365</span></span></div> <div class="candidate-child"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2365</span></span><Li> Flynn Morrison ( regular , seasons 2 -- 6 ) , Jet Jurgensmeyer ( season 7 ) and Evan and Luke Kruntchev ( recurring , season 1 ) as Boyd Baxter , son of Kristin and Ryan : Mike enjoys spending quality time with his grandson Boyd , and affectionately views him as the son he never had . Mike and Ryan often clash on how he should be raised . Boyd enjoys activities encouraged by both his father and grandfather . </Li><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2449</span></span></div> <div class="candidate-child"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2449</span></span><Li> Jordan Masterson ( regular , seasons 4 -- present ; recurring , seasons 2 -- 3 ) and Nick Jonas ( guest star , season 1 ) as Ryan Vogelson , Boyd 's Canadian father : Though Ryan initially fled when Kristin got pregnant , he returned to be involved in Boyd 's upbringing , and eventually the two reconciled and got engaged ( at the end of season 3 ) . Ryan holds liberal views , both politically and philosophically , and he and Mike routinely clash over their fundamentally opposing values ( mainly because Ryan 's are illogical and often hypocritical ) , especially when it comes to child - rearing . Ryan wishes to raise his son without religion , hunting culture and nationalism , however , neither Mike nor Kristin agree with this approach . His vegan diet , views on discipline , and what Mike sees as his oversensitivity are an affront to Mike 's beliefs , but Ryan generally enjoys being a thorn in Mike 's side . On rare occasions , Ryan and Mike agree on what is best for Boyd , but this usually puts them at odds with Kristin or Vanessa . Mike comes to reluctantly respect and like his son - in - law for standing up for what he believes and for being a loving husband and father . Upon Bud Baxter 's passing , Ryan assumes ownership and operation of the marijuana store . </Li><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2697</span></span></div> <div class="candidate-child"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2697</span></span><Li> Jonathan Adams as Chuck Larabee ( regular , seasons 4 -- present ; recurring , seasons 2 -- 3 ) , Mike and Vanessa 's neighbor : Chuck is a retired U.S. Marine and a veteran of the first Gulf War who runs a private security business and later takes charge of security for the Denver Outdoor Man . Chuck is an African - American , and often jokes with Mike about racial stereotypes , and they regularly exchange barbs as if they do n't like each other . In reality , they are good friends , despite being unwilling to admit it . Vanessa sees through their heated exchanges , often telling them to `` get a room '' . Chuck 's typical response to something or someone that exasperates him is , `` not cool '' . Chuck is married to Carol and they have a son , Brandon , who is the same age as Eve . </Li><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2859</span></span></div> </Ul><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">2860</span></span></div> <H3> Recurring ( edit ) </H3> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2866</span></span><Ul> <div class="candidate-child"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">2867</span></span><Li> Robert Forster as Bud Baxter ( seasons 1 , 3 -- 4 , 7 ) , Mike 's widower father who is initially in the construction business , but later opens a marijuana store ( `` Bud 's Buds '' ) after it becomes legal in Colorado .

A representative for 20th Century Fox Television said cancellation decisions are made by ABC . `` This was a scheduling decision , '' wrote Jori Arancio , senior vice president of ABC Entertainment and ABC Studios . ABC and its production partner for the show , 20th Century Fox Television , typically negotiate licensing fees prior to each season ; however , the network decided to cancel the show without doing so . Also , the contract between 20th Century Fox Television and ABC for the show , in which 20th Century Fox Television covered the cost of production , had expired after six seasons . Had the series been renewed for a seventh season , ABC would have been required to pick up Last Man Standing 's production costs , which the network was unwilling to do . </P><span class="tooltip tooltip-end"><span class="tooltiptext">5197</span></span></div> <div class="candidate"><span class="tooltip tooltip-start"><span class="tooltiptext">5197</span></span><P> The cancellation was met with outrage from the show 's fans , many of whom took to social media to voice their displeasure and petition for another network to pick up the show . It also happened some months after lead actor Tim Allen ( who is also a real - life Republican ) said in an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live ! , that being a Republican in Hollywood is `` like 1930s Germany . You got ta be real careful around here , you know . You 'll get beat up if you do n't believe what everybody believes '' .

Once we made the decision not to continue with comedy on Friday , it was just kind of that 's where we landed . '' Dungey cited studio ownership , future creative direction , ratings and viewer engagement as all factors in her decision .

The same day , TVLine reported that Fox was `` poised to '' resurrect Last Man Standing for the 2018 -- 19 TV season , adding that Tim Allen is `` officially on board '' . Deadline Hollywood reported that Fox was in talks for another season , but it was `` by no means a sure thing '' , suggesting it would depend on whether the actors could be re-signed `` at reasonable salaries '' . On May 11 , 2018 , Fox TV 's CEOs and chairmen announced that Fox had officially picked up Last Man Standing for a seventh season . Dana Walden , chairman of Fox Television Group , later hinted that the return of Last Man Standing was in part a response to the huge success of the Roseanne reboot on ABC earlier in 2018 : `` Obviously , I think everyone took a good , hard look at the performance of Roseanne . It did so well , and it certainly did remind us that we have a huge , iconic comedy star in our Fox family in Tim Allen .
